            "       b'smith wesson gun sales are exploding as people become concerned about their personal safety.photo screen capture from smith wesson video.turns out it wasnt the shot heard round the world.while many felt president barack obamas promise to do an end run around congress and enact new gun controls via executive action  would cripple the industry but spur massive gun sales in the interim its now being viewed as little more than incremental action at the edges.the stocks of gun manufacturers smith wesson holding  and sturm ruger  initially shot higher\\xc2\\xa0with the announcement of the executive action but have since returned to the levels they were trading at before the presidents press conference.but make no mistake gun stocks remain at markedly elevated levels.shares of smith wesson have more than doubled over the past year while ruger is up some 00NUMBER00.but while fear among gun owners and enthusiasts that the president would impose strict laws on ownership have fueled more than a few sales since he took office the white hot growth being witnessed in the past year seems to have little to do with anything obama was expected to propose and seems to have more to do with concerns about personal safety.earlier this month smith wesson announced that gun sales were growing at such a torrid pace it needed to scrap the earnings guidance  \\xc2\\xa0it gave just the month before and had raised from the prior quarter and would sharply boost its estimates of how well it would do in the fiscal third quarter and for the full year.quarterly net sales estimates were increased from a range between 00NUMBER00 million and 00NUMBER00 million to a new range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 million a 00NUMBER00 increase.quarterly earnings estimates were raised from a range between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 per share to a new range of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 per share better than a 00NUMBER00 increase.full year net sales estimate went from between 00NUMBER00 and 00NUMBER00 million up to a range of 00NUMBER00 million 00NUMBER00 million.full year earnings estimates were similarly raised from a range of 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00 per share to a new range of 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 per sharewhile many have said the presidents anti gun rhetoric backfired and drove gun sales higher there seems to be a more basic impetus driving sales.my review of the top five best selling handguns across all of 00NUMBER00 show those designed for personal protection  \\xc2\\xa0were the ones most sought.smith wessons mp shield models that it introduced in 00NUMBER00 have proved so popular that theyve quickly become the best selling personal protection and self defense pistol on the market with the gunmaker producing its one millionth model during the second quarter.designed to be slim concealable and lightweight theyre perfect for those desiring to protect themselves their families and their property.other gun manufacturers have also benefited from demand for firearms that are designed for concealed carry.glock sig sauer and taurus have all produced handguns that ranked as the most popular handguns as determined by gunbrokercom the worlds largest online auction site for firearms and accessories.but the most popular handgun using data from that site was the kel tec pmr 00NUMBER00 that offers 00NUMBER00 stacked.00NUMBER00 magnum rounds in a compact lightweight design.chart by author from data provided by the fbi.if nothing else 00NUMBER00 is going to be remembered as the year that broke all records for background checks conducted by the fbi for people wanting to buy a firearm.more so than 00NUMBER00 which saw previous records broken in the aftermath of the sandy hook shooting last year was marred by violent civil unrest in places such as ferguson mo.and baltimore while terrorist incidents in san bernardino calif.and paris and convinced more people than ever they needed an effective means of self defense.beginning in may and continuing every single month thereafter the fbi conducted more background checks on people wanting to buy a gun than at any other time for that particular month.it culminated in december when more than 00NUMBER00 million investigations were conducted the first time it ever cracked that threshold.for all of 00NUMBER00 the fbi performed over 00NUMBER00 background checks.so it was not gun buyers responding to just the presidents words but rather to events unfolding around the world and a primal need for self protection.thats not likely to abate anytime soon which means smith wesson and sturm ruger will likely be shooting out the lights for some time to come.the next billion dollar isecret   the worlds biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event but a few wall

            "       b'netflix  stock has been on a tear for the past 00NUMBER00 years rising from less than 00NUMBER00 to an all time high of more than 00NUMBER00 last month.this rally has been fueled by rapid subscriber growth that always seems to beat expectations no matter how aggressive those expectations had become.netflix 00NUMBER00 year stock chart data by ychartsinvestors got a rude awakening last week.while netflix managed to beat its guidance and the average analyst estimate for 00NUMBER00 earnings virtually everything else in its earnings report was discouraging.in fact netflix disappointed investors in 00NUMBER00 ways.slowing domestic growth was the first and most consequential way in which netflix disappointed investors.in july netflix projected that it would add 00NUMBER00 million members in the u.s.during 00NUMBER00.however netflix only managed to add 00NUMBER00 domestic subscribers.netflixs management tried to downplay this missed forecast.for the past few quarters netflix has provided its internal forecast for various metrics including subscriber growth.it had warned investors that sometimes it would beat this forecast and sometimes it would fall short.however this was the first time it fell short by more than 00NUMBER00 on any  metric.apparently netflixs forecasts arent as conservative as many investors had believed.fewer people than expected signed up for netflix last quarter photo the motley foola bigger warning sign was the fact that domestic growth was much slower than in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 when netflix added 00NUMBER00 million domestic streaming subscribers.this is the second straight quarter with lower domestic subscriber growth year over year.however while the 00NUMBER00 shortfall could be explained by seasonality that cant explain what happened last quarter.netflix executives attributed the weaker 00NUMBER00 growth to the impact of a 00NUMBER00 price increase applied to new subscribers back in may stating slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth.netflix is also projecting slower domestic growth 00NUMBER00 with 00NUMBER00 million subscriber additions down from 00NUMBER00 in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00.for the full year netflix now expects to add 00NUMBER00 million domestic streaming subscribers.thats down 00NUMBER00 from the 00NUMBER00 million added in 00NUMBER00.this indicates that saturation may be setting in   leading to progressively slower growth in each of the next few years.its too early to be sure that this is the case as subscriber growth has only been slowing for 00NUMBER00 quarters now.nevertheless netflix investors now need to take this threat seriously.in addition to reporting slower domestic growth netflix also released a revised target for margin growth in its domestic streaming business.for the past 00NUMBER00 years netflix has aimed to grow its domestic streaming contribution margin by 00NUMBER00 basis points per quarter or 00NUMBER00 basis points per year on average.so far it has outperformed this guidance.since 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 when netflix began reporting domestic streaming contribution margin that metric has risen from 00NUMBER00 to 00NUMBER00.it expects to keep its streaming contribution margin roughly flat in 00NUMBER00 which would amount to an average annual increase of almost 00NUMBER00 basis points for the past 00NUMBER00 years.in recent years netflix has grown its domestic streaming margin despite adding lots of expensive content photo the motley foolin july netflix disclosed that it was reevaluating its expectations for contribution margin growth beyond the 00NUMBER00 level which it expects to reach in early 00NUMBER00.last week netflix confirmed that it expects the domestic streaming contribution margin to rise by only 00NUMBER00 basis points annually going forward less than half of the recent growth rate.that includes the benefit of the recent price increase which will hit longtime netflix members in 00NUMBER00.this implies that content costs will rise faster than ever thanks to the addition of new original series netflixs foray into original movies new syndication deals such as the recently announced deal to bring friends  to netflix and the disney  pay tv window deal announced in 00NUMBER00.while netflixs domestic results disappointed investors in terms of the pace of revenue growth and margin expansion the companys international results werent great either.netflix gained 00NUMBER00 million international subscribers well below its forecast of 00NUMBER00 million international subscriber additions.this was still a substantial acceleration from the 00NUMBER00 international subscribers added in the prior year period.however netflix expanded its international addressable market by more than 00NUMBER00 with its entry into new markets like france and germany in september.in this context the gains werent very exciting.that said netflix was only available in its new markets for the last 00NUMBER00 weeks of 00NUMBER00.the real problem is that netflix is forecasting only 00NUMBER00 million international subscriber additions in 00NUMBER00.netflixs new european markets arent contributing much growth yet photo the motley foolwhile that would be better than the 00NUMBER00 million international subscribers it added in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 the projected increase in growth is less than 00NUMBER00.thats not much bang for the buck given the scale and cost of netflixs european expansion.the last way in which netflix disappointed investors was its forecast that international losses will remain high for the near future.first it announced that a change in value added tax rules will increase its average vat rate in europe by 00NUMBER00 points.since it isnt raising prices to compensate this amount comes directly out of its contribution margin.second cfo david wells stated that international contribution losses in the future\\xc2\\xa0could return to the peak level of 00NUMBER00 reached in 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00.that would be even greater than 00NUMBER00 million international contribution loss projected for next quarter.in other words investors may be in for a prolonged period of high international losses even though the international markets introduced before this year are collectively profitable.losses from the recently launched countries and future launches will overwhelm the earnings from other international territories.netflix stock fell nearly 00NUMBER00 on thursday following this disappointing earnings report.still some netflix bulls are undeterred.one analyst reduced his price target from 00NUMBER00 00NUMBER00 but still recommended the stock as a great buy  at current levels.another investment bank offered similar comments.another analyst called the stock sell off a tempest in a teapot that was an overreaction.in some sense a 00NUMBER00 sell off seems harsh for a company that is still growing quite rapidly.however i still think this is a bad time to bet on netflix because the stock price was far higher coming into the earnings report than it should have been.there was no way to predict that netflixs 00NUMBER00 earnings report would fall short of expectations in so many ways.however it should have been obvious that the company was likely to stumble at some point even the best businesses do from time to time.netflixs pre earnings stock price only made sense if netflix could go for years without hitting any bumps in the road.analysts still seem to be overconfident about netflix stock.in spite of all the news delivered on wednesday many analysts are still projecting strong earnings growth next year due to margin expansion.however between rising corporate overhead costs the european vat increase rising content costs and slowing domestic growth this scenario now seems less realistic.of course its possible that netflixs subscriber growth is about to reaccelerate and it will return to its earlier trend of routinely crushing its guidance.netflixs disappointing 00NUMBER00 why investors shouldnt count on that.slower domestic growth may be the new normal and international profitability may still be a few years away.your cable company is scared but you can get rich    you know cables going away.but do you know how to profit\\xc2\\xa0theres 00NUMBER00
